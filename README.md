# The Voice of the Customer: Using NLP and Social Media to Extract Valuable Customer Feedback 
This script was created for the DATAcated Conference on May 19, 2021. This project uses Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to extract customer feedback from social media about a certain product. Social media data was extracted from the Sentiment140 Twitter dataset (http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/). Only tweets that contain the word "iphone" are included in the analysis.

The goal of this analysis is to identify customer feedback and sentiments toward our "product", the iphone, and classify each tweet into a category based on the keywords it contains using k-means clustering.
