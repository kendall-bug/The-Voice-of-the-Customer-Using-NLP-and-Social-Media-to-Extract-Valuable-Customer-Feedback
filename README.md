# The Voice of the Customer: Using NLP and Social Media to Extract Valuable Customer Feedback 
This script was created for the DATAcated Conference on May 19, 2021. This project uses Natural Language Processing and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to show how companies can extract customer feedback from social media about a certain product. Social media data was extracted from the Sentiment140 dataset (http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/). To focus in on a specific product, only tweets that contain the word "iphone" are included in the analysis.

The goal of this analysis is to obtain customer feedback and identify consumer sentiment toward our "product", the iphone. Futher, to identify if there are any recurring themes in what the customers are conversing about, each tweet is classified into a category based on its subject matter using k-means clustering.
